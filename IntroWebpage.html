                <h1>Darien</h1>

                <h1> Favorite culture you're not native to?</h1>
                <p>For me it'd be Mongolia, I envy their diet and their culture of wrestling and horseback riding everyday.</p>

                <h1> Build a bouquet of 3 flowers that represent you in the language of flowers.</h1>
                <p>I'll be choosing Lavender, Sunflower, and the white flowers that spawn off an apple tree. I choose these because they are useful. Lavender is only here for a short time, and is the most fragrant.</p>

                <h1>One historical figure you wish to be like?</h1>
                <p>I would wish to be like Harald Hardrada. Harald Hardrada, a Norwegian prince exiled at 15, embarked on a life of epic adventure. He first sought refuge in Kievan Rus', where he honed his skills as a warrior and earned the favor of powerful rulers. From there, he journeyed to Byzantium, becoming a legendary commander in the Varangian Guard, fighting across the empire and amassing great wealth. Returning to Norway, Harald seized the throne, but his thirst for adventure led him to launch a daring invasion of England in 1066. His saga ended in a fierce battle at Stamford Bridge, where the last great Viking fell, marking the end of the Viking Age.</p>

                <h1> A Meal that represents you </h1>
                <p>I would choose palascinta, it's a Hungarian crepe that I ate throughout my childhood, good with jam, easy to make and a light satiating snack.</p>

                <h1> Finish the sentence: "I feel most creative when..."</h1>
                <p>When there is little distraction but in a wide enough area for inspiration to surround one's self</p>

                <h1> If you could only talk about one topic what would it be?</h1>
                <p>Nature.</p>
